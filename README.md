Purpose
=======

The iStat Add-On to WebCTRL Provides simple occupant access to a zone's setpoints and current temperature
through an iPhone.  This only allows access to adjusting setpoint offsets
(just like you would on the actual room sensor).  It does not allow access to changing the real underlying setpoints.

Project Status
--------------
While this initial checkin is functional, it needs some work to be ready for real production use.
Outstanding issues:

* Remove vestigial files (left over from initial experimentation)
* Error handling in general needs to be reviewed
* JavaScript needs some clean up
* Some JavaScript needs to be minified when not debugging
* We could use better graphics for the main zone page
